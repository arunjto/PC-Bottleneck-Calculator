                "q": "What is a PC bottleneck?",
                "a": "A <strong>PC bottleneck</strong> happens when one component limits the performance of the whole system. For example, even with a high-end GPU, a weaker CPU may prevent it from reaching full potential."
            },
            {
                "q": "Is a CPU or GPU bottleneck worse?",
                "a": "For gaming, a mild <strong>GPU bottleneck</strong> is usually fine because it means your graphics card is working fully. A strong <strong>CPU bottleneck</strong> is worse, as it often causes stuttering and inconsistent frame rates."
            },
            {
                "q": "How accurate is the bottleneck calculator?",

            {
                "q": "Do RAM or storage also cause bottlenecks?",
                "a": "Yes. Insufficient or slow <strong>RAM</strong> can cause stutters in heavy workloads. Similarly, using an <strong>HDD</strong> instead of an SSD will lead to slower loading times."
            },

                "q": "Should CPU and GPU both run at 100%?",
                "a": "Ideally, your <strong>GPU</strong> should be close to full utilization for gaming. CPU usage will vary, and it’s not always ideal for it to hit 100%. If CPU is maxed out but GPU is underutilized, that’s a clear CPU bottleneck."
